ICS111-HAL9001
==============

(Hopfully) Central place where our ICS team will be working on their assigned scripts.

IMPORTANT: When you first clone this into your computer. If there's nothing in Eclipse's project directory, then make a new Java project called "TextPaser". This will cause Ecilpse to recognize the missing files.

These scripts will be used to animate images and be based around the music, Space Oddity https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaOC9danxNo
